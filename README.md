# Portfolio v 3.0

## 0. Introduction

For this new version of my portfolio, I wanted to focus on a more minimalistic website layout that focused on one thing:  
Deliver a clear message of what I do and how I do it, while catching the user eye with complementary animations.
Another issue that has been bugging me it's the lack of a design eye when I come up with websites. Something that I have been working a lot on lately.

## 1. Identifying the problem

The version 2 of my portfolio had certain elements that I were really proud of, but in general, the more I looked at it, the more it felt like a bunch of different pieces wrapped up together badly.

### 1.1 The bad

- The layout of the site felt too linear and boring.
- While there’s some animation in the website, I don’t want just a show-up-on-scroll effect. It needs a bit more of dynamism, but I don't want to clutter it.
- The **Landing page**:
  - The first impression that the site gives is weak and lacks of enough information to catch the attention of the user.
  - The heading is vague. And it’s been a year and a half at least since I built the site. I’ve come a long way learning and consider myself still a Junior Dev, but with enought knowledge to work on the server side, or desktop and mobile apps.
  - The background image while being an awesome shot per se, didn’t feel unique or empowered a brand identity. The mobile version substitutes it with an ugly background color that I placed when I first built the website and never got changed.
  - The navigation bar hover effect is cool, I’m proud of that. But in general feels flat, and is more of an annoyance when it comes to explore the site. I wanted to keep it fixed in the screen, but not taking a massive screen state. It shouldn’t break the story-telling for first-time visitors. Just enhance in case you want to see a certain bit of the page.
- The **About/Skills section**:
  - The paragraph about me. I had a big struggle writing it down, and I sitll say that it doesn't represent me. I know I have to work on the way to sell myself. It unnecessarily develops into telling a story that the user may not be interested in knowing. Instead, it should be a short introduction with the aim of being expanded if the user is interested.
  - The cliche skills-chart. Dull, not innovative at all, and shouts “I can evaluate my own skills”. It's cool to see it, but literally every junior dev out there has it, and honestly, it says shit. It’s the user the one who should judge the profesionalism looking at the website. That's what I want. I still will show the technologies I use, but not mark them from 1/10.
- **Work section**:
  - The background image doesn’t say much. Plus it has jQuery on it. Jose, please, don’t use jQuery. Not even show it. Just please.
  - So far, all the projects shown are snippets or experimental apps practicing JavaScript. The aim here is to show a portfolio of 3 - 4 websites, leaving this minor things to a different section. Playground, maybe.
- **Contact section**:
  - The footer is simple and gets all the social media icons there. But ideally, the GitHub and CodePen profiles should be easier to access. There should be some room for a resume and maybe a simple contact form.

### 1.2 The good

- The chosen font was love at first sight. I am changing it but it's going to resemble the previous one.
- The colour palette. We are going to throw away the dark theme, and bring on a bright aura in the site while trying to implement the flag of the Canary Islands as complementary colors.
- The section headings with the dash have a simple and clean effect that I want to keep.
